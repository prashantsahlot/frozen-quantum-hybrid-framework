## 🚀 What is FrozenQuantumHybridFramework?

**FrozenQuantumHybridFramework** is the first open-source framework designed to prepare developers for the future of quantum computing.

Imagine a world where games, heavy simulations, and advanced applications run on quantum machines — this framework gives you the tools to start building that future today.

---

## 💎 Features

✅ Build future-ready applications and games.  
✅ Prepare your code for upcoming quantum coprocessors.  
✅ Hybrid approach: CPU decides, quantum executes ("burst" concept).  
✅ Open-source and community-driven.  
✅ Non-commercial use with full credit to **Frozen Bots**.  
✅ Designed for visionary developers and researchers.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/prashantsahlot/frozen-quantum-hybrid-framework.git

# Move into the directory
cd frozen-quantum-hybrid-framework

# (Optional) Setup your virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 💬 Example Usage

### Basic Simulation

```python
from fqhf import QuantumEngine

qe = QuantumEngine()
qe.prepare_environment()
result = qe.run_future_simulation(data="my_game_data")
print(result)
```

### Hybrid CPU-decider + Quantum-executor Converter

```python
from examples import converter

# Just run: python examples/converter.py
```
